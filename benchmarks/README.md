Collects benchmarks from
[IVy](https://github.com/kenmcmil/ivy),
[I4](https://github.com/GLaDOS-Michigan/I4),
[FOL Separators](https://github.com/jrkoenig/folseparators),
[Paxos made EPR](https://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~odedp/paxos-made-epr.html),
[mypyvy](https://github.com/wilcoxjay/mypyvy),
as well as some benchmarks written for SWISS.

In most cases, there is both a .ivy version and a .pyv version. For some, the .ivy is
the original; for others, the .pyv is the original. In each case, the other one was
translated by hand.
